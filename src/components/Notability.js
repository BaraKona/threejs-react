                Notability is a concept brought to life during the summer of 2019 before my first year of university.
                <br></br><br></br>I wanted to gain some coding experience before I started my course, and having had no
                previous experience in computer science other than modding games and *torrenting software, it was a great place to start.   
            </body1>
            <body2>
            Using visual studio,  stack overflow and an impossible number of youtube videos, I brought my project to life.
            <br></br><br></br>The concept was to make an application to boost my productivity.
